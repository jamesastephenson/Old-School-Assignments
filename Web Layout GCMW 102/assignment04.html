	<h1>James Stephenson - Assignment 4</h1>
	
	<p>Hello, my name is James Stephenson. I was born in Western New York but moved to California in 2017. Initially I was living in Santa Cruz, but later came to San Marcos and have lived here for a few years now.</p>
	
	<p>Some of my hobbies include playing guitar and cooking East Asian food. Lately I've been making Mapo Tofu, which has been a fun skill to improve at. I've put a recipe for the dish in the link below.</p>
