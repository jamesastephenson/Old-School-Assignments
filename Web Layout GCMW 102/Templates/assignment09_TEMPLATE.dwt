		<p>Our Town: <br>
		  <br>
		  Everwinter Valley was founded in 1895 by acclaimed explorer John Everwinter. For many years it was sustained by a rich lumber industry, but in modern times it has been used for many film shoots and vacation getaways due to its captivating natural beauty. Our town has a small population of approximately 2000 people, though most of them commute to urban centers rather than working within the town itself. <br>
  <br>
		  The name has led many to mistakenly think that our town is a cold, frigid area, but that also lends it a certain scenic charm. We hope you'll visit soon! </p>
